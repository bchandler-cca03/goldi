            <p>Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Goldilocks.  She  went for a 
                walk in the forest.  Pretty soon, she came upon a house.  She knocked and, 
                when no one answered, she walked right in.</p>

            <p>At the table in the kitchen, there were three bowls of porridge.  Goldilocks 
                was hungry.  She tasted the porridge from the first bowl.</p>

            <h6>What did <span>Goldilocks</span> say?  [Notice how this pathetic h6 is smaller than a paragraph]</h6>
            
            <a href="goldi1.html">"This porrige is too hot! she exclaimed.</a>
            <p></p>
            <a href="goldi2.html">"Are you kidding?  Who eats porridge?"</a>
