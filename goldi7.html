                <h4>Our Little Charmer has now committed the crime of breaking and entering ...</h4>
                    
                <p> After he had eaten the three bears' breakfasts she decided she was feeling a 
                    little tired.  So, she walked into the living room where she saw three chairs.  
                    Goldilocks sat in the first chair to rest her feet.  </p>
        
                <p>"This chair is too big!" she exclaimed.</p>
                
                <p>So she sat in the second chair.</p>
        
                <p>"This chair is too big, too!"  she whined.</p>

                <h6>Did Little Goldie really whine about the chair being too big?</h6>
